# Obsidian Docs

## Requirements

Gulp & Jekyll

```
npm i -g gulp-cli
gem install jekyll
```

## Getting Started

All descriptions are under `_includes/descriptions`. Most snippets are under `_includes/snippets`, other snippets are compiled by Gulp. There is a submodule that gets referenced by Jekyll for CSS examples.

```
git clone charlespeters/obsidian
git checkout docs
npm install && gulp 
```
