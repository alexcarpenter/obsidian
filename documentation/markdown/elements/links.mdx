import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { Links } from '../../components/demo/links'
import links from '../../components/demo/links.css.txt'

Simple styling for links and a class to apply to elements that need similar styling but aren't an anchor tag.

<Snippet snippet={links} component={Links} />
