import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { InputGroup, snippet } from './demo/input-group'

This is a visual pattern for any time you want `<input type="text">` inlined with a button. Admittedly this component is a little rough around the edges.

<Snippet component={InputGroup} snippet={snippet} />
