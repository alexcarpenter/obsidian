import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { Colors, snippet } from './demo/colors'

Colors are pretty barebones in Obsidian. They provide sensible defaults to get going with if you're prototyping but have the ability to be overridden. Most of the values are generated from [postcss-color-function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function).

<Snippet component={Colors} snippet={snippet} />
