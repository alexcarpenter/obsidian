### Media Queries

This project uses [mobile-first media queries](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/#toc-style-mobilefirst), meaning that a base set of styles is targeted and then styled conditionally for increasing larger viewports. `--sm` targets viewports 500px wide and larger, `--md` targets viewports 768px wide and larger, `--lg` targets viewports 924px wide and larger, finally `--xl` targets 1200px and wider.

```css
@custom-media --sm only screen and (width >= 31.25rem);
@custom-media --md only screen and (width >= 48rem);
@custom-media --lg only screen and (width >= 57.75rem);
@custom-media --xl only screen and (width >= 75rem);
```
