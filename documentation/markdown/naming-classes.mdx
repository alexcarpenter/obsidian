Classes in Obsidian are named with purpose.

### Prefixes

Objects, components, and utilities are all prefixed (`.o-`, `.c-`, `.u-`). This leads to clear class names, class names we can search for an `outline` for QA. It also puts a hard line between objects and components.

#### Exceptions

Elements are not prefixed (ie. `.list`, `.table`) because they extend responsive ability or serve as a opt-in default for an element vs opinionated styling. Classes in `obsidian.forms-ui` add specific opinionated styling that's common to projects.

### Suffixes

Obsidian uses responsive suffixes `@sm`. Responsive targeting shouldn't be a modifier and falls in its own category. Obsidian defaults to a mobile first approach to CSS, meaning that classes without suffixes apply their styles to all screen sizes and ascend upward for styling per suffix.

`@sm`, `@md`, `@lg` are the given suffixes in Obsidian.

### BEM

[BEM](https://en.bem.info/) is a naming convention that gives class names informative and clear meaning.

```
.block__element--modifier {
  /* Declarations */
}
```

#### Block Names

Blocks can be described as squares you can draw around a piece of UI or the root of a module (visual or conceptual). Most block names should be really simple, so avoid abbreviating or complicating. If two words are needed to describe a block separate them with a single hyphen `-`.

Blocks are the basis of a name. They can have both a modifier and a element attached (`.block__element--modifier`) or have just have one (either a modifier `.block--modifier` or an element `.block__element`.

Utilities in Obsidian get a specific block name that describes their function. For example `d` abbreviating `display` or `bkg` abbreviating `background`.

#### Element Names

Elements are pieces of a block separated from a block by a double underscore `__`. `.c-modal__close` would refer to a close link for a modal component, `.o-intrinsic__item` would refer to the item in the intrinsic container.

#### Modifier Names

Modifiers add to the block or element in some way, hence modifying it. `.o-icon--sm` would refer to a small icon object and `.o-grid__col--3/12` would refer to a grid column that's 3 parts of 12.

Utility modifiers get a single hyphen `-`.
