import { Snippet } from '../../components/snippet'
import { UIList, snippet } from './demo/ui-list'

Typically, in a project, you may want to reset a list like this for navigation or displayed options but you might not want to override the default `<ul>` element. This pattern gives you that flexibility.

<Snippet component={UIList} snippet={snippet} />
