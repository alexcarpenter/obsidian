The [flag object](http://csswizardry.com/2013/05/the-flag-object/) is a UI pattern that's very similar to the media object. There are two key differences, for one it doesn't assume left aligned figure. And then the flag object is flexible in regards to vertical alignment. Like the above media object implementation, it doesn't wrap content onto two lines.
