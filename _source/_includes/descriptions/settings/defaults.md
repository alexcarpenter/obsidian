There are lots of default declarations in this project, notably Obsidian uses a base space of `1rem` for most things, `100%` for an initial `font-size`, a base container size of `75rem` (`~1200px`) and default of 375 milliseconds for transitions. For information about `rem` units check out [The Lengths of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/#article-header-id-7) from CSS-Tricks.

For font families themselves, there's a few font stacks (that you should override for your needs) for sans-serif, serif and monospace fonts; plus there's a system font stack. The current default font is the system font stack.
